# NESTKP
NES emulator written in C++ for TKPEmu    

This project is currently empty.    
It is planned to be mid-instruction timing correct by splitting the instructions and pushing the subactions into a queue.    
Whenever you pop the queue, any timer/ppu/other stuff that needs to happen gets triggered.
